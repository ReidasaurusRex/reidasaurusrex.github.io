# This is the source code for my personal webiste. 

The site is built using Jekyll. I enjoy using Jekyll because it: 

* gives me the control I want
* is easily deployable to GitHub Pages
* the hosting is free

On this site, you can find my blog, resume, and whatever else I feel like putting up.

It is hosted at reidhlewis.com

### Cheers
