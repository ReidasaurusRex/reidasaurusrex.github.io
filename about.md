My name's Reid, and this is my little plot of internet-land. 

For work, I like to 

* make coffee
* write `code`
* try to help run a company

For play, I like to 

* write `code`
* play piano
* ride my bike
* struggle at yoga
* write, like, in English
* drink good beer with friends

When I try to describe myself, I use words like

* tall
* environmentalist
* mindful-ish
* minimalist
* curious

The company I'm working on is called <a href="http://www.nu.world/" title="check us out!" target="_blank">Nu.world</a>. We're working to provide a social platform that incentivizes users to take personal responsibility and control of their environmental impact.
