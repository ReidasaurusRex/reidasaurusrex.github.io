    <p>I find the world to be a fascinating and wildly complex place. From time to time I really enjoy jotting down some thoughts that help me to articulate and solidify some of what I feel are more interesting and challenging ideas. There's not really any structure here. Good luck.</p>

    <p>Here are some things I've written about recently:</p>
    
    <ul>
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }} • {{post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y"}}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    <p>I hope you find something you enjoy reading.</p>
