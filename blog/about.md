# About this blog

I find the world to be a fascinating place, and like to think about my existence in it. Sometimes, the thoughts I'm lead to will foster writing them down to try to sort through, or will maybe strike me as thoughts I think others would enjoy reading. When this happens, I try to articulate them into a post.

Often I'm thinking about technology, the environment, quality of life, or my attempt at minimalism. You'll find that the things I write about frequently correlate to these topics. I'm also particularly interested in the places where things come together. This is the reason many of the things I discuss might seem completely unrelated, but I enjoy exploring where they might overlap. 

Whether you too often think about these things, or are simply willing to take time out of your day to explore the world from my perspective, I hope you'll find something you enjoy reading. 

Cheers.
