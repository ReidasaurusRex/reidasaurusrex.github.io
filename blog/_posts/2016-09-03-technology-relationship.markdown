title: Technology and I
excerpt: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bit
---

As a kid, I used to love bouncing on my trampoline. I wasn't practicing flips or throwing around a ball, though. I was using the forces of bouncing on my body to pull myself deeper into my own imagination; I was bouncing around through imaginary worlds. Exploring these worlds of mine became arguably my favorite pastime; more than soccer, more than snowboarding, I enjoyed finding my way through fantasy. 

As I grew older, the trampoline turned into a TV screen and a controller. The unnamed realms in my mind gave way to Oblivion and Final Fantasy, Fable and Kingdom Hearts. When not in school or playing sports, you could likely find my friends and I playing video games together. 

In college, I began to see my gaming habit as more of an addiction. Unfortunately, an ankle injury kept me in my dorm room for much of my Freshman year, and video games provided a wonderful, injury friendly distraction. Despite the realizations I was beginning to have about the potential negative effects of gaming on my life, I continued unimpeded in my forays into Starcraft and League of Legends. 

> The childhood wonder had returned, but this time tethered to reality.

Gaming continued to have a large role in my life all through college. In hindsight, I wish I'd spent more time partying with friends and studying, and less time gaming or watching Netflix. Technological distraction was comfortable, and comfortable was welcome in the demanding life of college. However, I've since realized that comfortable is not necessarily good. I realized there wasn't any more exploration in my tech based pastimes. Only distraction. 

After graduating, I had the great fortune to do some traveling abroad. I went to some fantastic places and spent time with equally fantastic people, and my worldview received a much needed revival. Suddenly I found myself exploring again, and it was not only healthy and beneficial, but also incredibly exciting and fulfilling. The childhood wonder I'd felt on the trampoline had returned, but this time tethered to reality. 

Once home, I was faced with the all too common phenomenon of not knowing what to "do with my life". My cousin and his excellent girlfriend were visiting in Flagstaff, and I learned about her recent studies as a front end web developer at a boot camp in San Francisco. After some questioning and poking around, I figured development had a great salary and seemed interesting, and I enrolled in a boot camp myself. 

My three months at the boot camp were difficult. Beyond the ~ 70 hours a week I was putting in towards learning to be a developer, I was also transitioning to city life in San Francisco from my quiet home town. My skills and habits from college did me well, but eventually I had a pretty fierce burnout. My overtime with software, and being in such a tech-oriented city, began to quickly shift my perception of technology to negative.

> I've learned exploration is not an action, but a perspective.

This negative perception persisted until after I'd completed the boot camp. Rather than look for a job as a developer, I moved back to Flagstaff where I took a job as a barista. On the side, however, I began pursuing my final project for the boot camp as a business with some friends. Though built with software, I'd hoped the product would encourage individuals, among many things, to get out and explore the world around them again. 

Building this business required me to be a much better developer than I was after graduating from my boot camp, so I bit the bullet and continued bettering my development skills. Steadily, I learned about the wondrous world of computers, from the transistors creating an electrical 0 or 1 to the high end coding languages I was using to build a web application. This learning was not impeding my quality of life; if anything, quite the opposite. The begrudged furthering of my developer abilities shed light into an incredible world that for so long had just been a black box. 

I've grown to really enjoy exploring this world. I no longer see the 1s and 0s of the technological world as being in conflict with a life of experiencing the world around us. Rather, I now appreciate the fact that they are a large part of that world. I've learned that exploration is not an action, but a perspective, and that that perspective can just as easily be applied to the computer in front of you as it is applied to the canyon or mountain nearby. 

I still feel there is an inherent joy and benefit from exploring the natural world, and I hope to keep this exploration a large part of my life as I grow older. However, with balance, I feel that the smart use of technology in my life is by no means a negative aspect. It is here, and I believe it can be a great tool for humanity to address the problems we face and further explore the universe around us. The trampoline of my youth has given way to the world I live in; I think technology can help us all jump a little higher.
