title: The Medium & The Metaphor
excerpt: A post about posting.
---

I recently took a drive up to Salt Lake City to visit the rest of the Nu team and take care of some things. Before the drive, I'd decided to splurge and buy an audio book, something I'd been contemplating doing for quite some time and had never really tried out. The audio book I decided on was Nicholas Carr's _The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains_.

The central theme of the book is pretty apparent from the title: the author attempts to explain the effects of widespread and frequent usage of the internet on our brains' physical makeup and resultant thought processes. The book has been a great listen (bizarre to say), and I'd highly recommend it. I feel the gist of the author's argument can be distilled to the following: usage of the internet has lead to an increased difficulty of individuals to think and contemplate upon subjects for extended periods of time. 

This conclusion leaves me in at least slight dismay. I view my ability and desire for deep thought with a near spiritual reverence; if our most separating characteristic from other animal species is our ability for critical thought, and a 'god' has any 'vision' for us, I believe it is to utilize this capacity to further understand and explore the universe around us. The majority of the posts I write are reflections upon or descriptions of these explorations, hoping others will find value in the differing persepctive they might provide. As a result, I hope that the posts you read here are challenging, and require the very deep thought Carr states is becoming more difficult to realize. 

I have already experienced the struggle this paradox brings about. Just a few nights ago, a friend of mine told me that he had read my blog post. Well, he hadn't finished it, but he'd looked at it. My arguments and reflections, which I attempt each post to articulate upon throughout its duration, are often difficult or impossible to glean if the article is not viewed in its entirety. 

On one hand, this doesn't bother me too much. A lot of the reason I write here is to further explore my own thoughts, and thus, selfishly, I don't care too much about how these posts are received. However, were I simply writing for my own benefit, there'd be no reason to spend the time writing the files in Markdown and posting them to this website. I'm optimistic that these posts may sometimes benefit the life of you, dear reader, and I, again selfishly, take both pride and pleasure in that prospect. 

So what's a deep thought blog author to do? I want neither to sacrifice the depth and complexity of the reflections I try to share, nor do I want to make them so inaccessible that sharing is pointless. The conclusion I've come to rests somewhere in the gray space between the two: an attempt to format posts to be accessible without sacrificing the depth of the content they represent.

> You can expect to see more pull quotes

Much of the what drives the shift Carr speaks of are all of the distractions of the web. The very fabric of the internet, its inter-connectiveness, provides us with too many decisions to make about what links to follow or not, what media to pay attention to, if you should keep on this tab or flick to your Facebook on the next one. Beyond this web structure, the very backlighting of the screen causes visual stress far greater than that of a book, making it physically more difficult to focus on text for longer periods of time. 

The compromise I've arrived at attempts to primarily address these issues. In the past, I'd linked hypertext <a href="#" onclick="(function(e){e.preventDefault(); console.log('&#59;&#41;');})(event)">like so</a>. Now, I'll opt for any possible links to be at the end of the text, with brief descriptions to make their relevance apparent. Additionally, I'll try to format my posts after writing them in ways that have attention grabbing hooks. You can expect to see more pull quotes, section headers, and all the things bloggers do to attempt to make their posts 'sexy'.

I'm hoping that such small changes can reduce the stress on your mind while also keeping it entertained, ideally permitting you to enjoy the post in its entirety and intention, should you choose to. I don't yet feel the need, nor do I feel prepared, to sacrifice sentence complexity, diction, and all the other engaging aspects of writing that keep me coming back to write on this blog. I certainly don't feel ready to sacrifice the integrity of the content of what I'm writing about. 

It's distinctly possible that this blog will soon, or already is, almost entirely personal, its contents too lengthy or boring to engage the average reader. Obviously I hope this is not the case, and am hopeful that such tweaks as those above will make reading these posts more enjoyable and accessible. If I permit my inner optimist even more, I hope this accessibility and joy will encourage both you and I to continue to engage in meaningful discourse about meaningful topics, allowing us both to seek a deeper quality of life not often found in the shallows.
