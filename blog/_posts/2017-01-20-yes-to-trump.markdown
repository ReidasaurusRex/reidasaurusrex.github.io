title: Say Yes to Trump
excerpt: An Alternative Perspective
---

I think no is sexy in our political climate; that the aisle in Congress is more of a mountain range and it's easier to be heard shouting NO than whispering yes. I think shouting no is incredibly important. When faced with some actions or statements so starkly harming, such as assaulting women, screaming NO as loud as you can is the only logical and realistic response. It's not my goal to condemn no, nor to condemn protest or resistance. However, I think too often we get lost in the allure of no, and forget that we can also say yes.

In my opinion resistance is only half the battle. I feel that if we have ideals we truly believe are just and worthy, they will not be attained by just condemning those movements that take us further from them; we must also actively puruse these ideals in our everyday lives. This pursuit, I have found, is best partaken in by saying yes to those actions, causes, habits, and ideologies that enable the ideals we seek. I've found that this has a wonderful secondary effect: not only progressing the movements you hope for, but also nullifying those that you fight. 

I've found truly enacting these worthy efforts to be difficult; I am tremendously far from perfect. However, on this most auspicious of days, I thought it might be a good reminder to think of some things we might say yes to: 

**Say yes to scrutiny.** I feel placing a blanket no against the incoming administration will do nothing but harm ourselves and the planet. If the policy they propose goes against our ideals, we should say no. However, I hope that we don't say no simply due to who is proposing it. Thus, I hope we are scrutinous of our administration, but also of our media, that we do not fall into the trap of blackballing that which might be helpful. 

**Say yes to wise spending.** The local bookstore is not allocating portions of their budget to lobby congress, nor perpetuate wealth consolidation. By spending our dollar in the right places, we can remove income from those companies whose policies we disagree with, and enable those companies who are good to our economies, communities, and environments. 

**Say yes to volunteering.** Funding may soon dry up for many institutions that assist causes we are passionate for. Though I hope our volunteering will not fill the place of salaried employees, I feel we must assist these institutions until they have funding to acquire the staff they need once more.

**Say yes to climate responsibility.** The incoming administration has made it abundantly clear that they don't believe in climate change. I think it's our duty to put pressure on them to correct this view. However, and I apologize if I sound like a broken record, I also feel it is our duty and privilege to do what we can in our own lives to mitigate the negative effects of our lifestyles on the planet. 

**Say yes to acknowledging your power.** Yes, the people in government positions may have more sway in things than your average bear. This does not mean that the average bear is powerless. If you feel like the world is coming to its end or is only worsening, I would encourage this thought: fuck that. You don't need them. They will never get your resolve, your hope, your individuality. Go and make it better yourself.
