title: Shooting Each Other
---

This morning, a student at the university in the town I live in decided to grab his gun and fire upon another human. He killed one, and injured three. When I heard the news, what seemed like a million different thoughts went racing through my head. Why? How are the kids in the hospital? Why? How does somebody lose their composure enough to kill over some argument? Why?

Among all of these thoughts, maybe the most jarring was the following: why aren’t I feeling more of an emotional response? I think of a lot of it, unfortunately, is that I’ve become numb to the pain. When I hear about another gun death in this country, my mind registers it as just that: another gun death. Another school shooting.

My first thought is no longer tragedy, it is statistic.

When I realized this pattern going on in my mind today, my response was pretty straight forward: what in the world is wrong with me? How is it that I hear about a young man being prematurely ripped from this life and from his family and friends, and my instinct is not even one of surprise, but of commonplace? This prompted a whole new chain of thought: how can I reshape myself that, no matter how many news stories I read, I can still recognize and feel a tragedy as a tragedy?

I guess I find myself at a bit of a handicap in this arena; I’ve always valued my mind over my heart, and my response to any problem has been to solve first, sympathize later. However, as I continue on this bizarre expedition we call adulthood (and life), I am beginning to understand that feeling the pain of a tragedy is essential. I think we need it to understand one another, and to motivate us to make the world a better place.

So what do I do, to become a person who feels a bit more deeply? Who can feel a tragedy, not just hear about it?

First and foremost: I don’t know. But I do have a few things I’m going to intentionally try:

#### 1. Pay More Attention ####

There’s no way I can do my best to empathize with a situation if I don’t know it happened. For me, this means paying more attention to local news sources so I can understand my community more, but also global ones as well. This should be pretty straightforward, but I’ve found it’s a bit more difficult. What sources do I follow, and how much time can I commit to trying to really get to the truth of what’s happening out there?

#### 2. Use My Imagination ####

Probably not one you were expecting to see on this list, but I feel it to be drastically important. Most of my news comes to me through the same device I am using now to write this blog post. They are words on a screen, with maybe the occasional audio or video clip. I, nor any loved ones, have any bullets in our side, and the building around me is not falling to pieces as the result of a bombing. Thus, it’s difficult for me to empathize if I keep myself in the mental space of sitting comfortably and looking at a laptop. I need to intentionally try to create a different mental space; one of tragedy and stress. If I really give it my all, it will suck. No two ways about it. But I think that jarring from my comfort is absolutely necessary if I really want to feel and learn from a tragedy.

#### 3. Take More Time ####

I see this as being very related to the prior. My life is extremely fast paced; I get my news in a feed that is jumbled up with postings ranging from life developments to what someone is having for dinner. If I had to guess at an average, I’d say I spend about five to fifteen seconds processing a snippet of news, depending on how long it takes me to read the subheading. I need to slow down, and actually take some time to a: gather a lot more information about things that deserve paying attention to, and b: process what that information means for myself, the community, the country, and the world.

I don’t know if this approach will work, but it’s where I plan to start. In my opinion, this is the first step I can take towards trying to stop these shootings. Of course, right now, I can say shootings are bad. No problem saying that. But I think if we really, really want to change as a society, and actually get these shootings to stop, I need to not only say that, but feel it, and feel it strongly. Unfortunately, I don’t really know anymore what it feels like to live in a peaceful society. Not only does the society I live in have an affinity for shooting ourselves, but for the past fourteen plus years we have deployed men and women of our country to go out and shoot other humans who happen to be in a different country. I see it all as being intertwined, this seeming indifference to violence and its perpetuation. I feel a duty to my community, both local and global, to try and bring this violence to a stop. Now, I need to feel more than that duty. I need to feel tragedy.
