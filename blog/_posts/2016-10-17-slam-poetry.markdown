title: Slam Poetry
excerpt: I reflect on a growing passion
---

About a month back, I went to a local slam poetry event for the first time. I'd been looking for an evening activity that wasn't just having a couple beers, and knew that Flagstaff had some local poetry events. The event was about two hours of local poets coming up to the mic and slamming about some of their most intimate thoughts and feelings. 

I was pretty instantly hooked. Here were people striking out, boldly breaking the mold of what I often feel is an emotionally stifling society. Tales of love, loss, and everything in between were freely given for anybody willing to listen. It was like having a little window into the lives of the performers; a window that normally wouldn't present itself until after years of friendship, if you were lucky. 

I walked away from that Wednesday feeling extremely lucky to have stumbled upon such a fascinating event. I was eager to go back next week, and thoughts started to formulate of how I could help the community. The obvious one was right in front of me: I could give back by performing. 

> What had been a mere inclination towards slam poetry became an adamant passion

About once a month I write a poem. There's no schedule to it, no agenda; I'm not writing in anticipation of publishing a book or pushing a message. I write poetry as a cathartic expression, to aid me in handling difficult emotions or thoughts that require more than just a deep breath or two. Yet, in my usual routine, I (try to) practice mindfulness and yoga, incorporate physical activiy, and engage in relationships with people I care about. I feel very lucky that these tendencies usually leave me feeling pretty happy. The average day is usually a good one. 

An unexpected side effect, however, was I didn't feel I had much material to draw on. It's been rare to have an emotion so strong and so unabaiting that I felt the ability to share it with others in a meaningful way. Outside of one achy heart following a close friend's wedding, I haven't written anything that's persisted to a desire to present. 

So time passed. I kept going to these local slams, kept being moved by the messages I heard. Eventually I heard of a large poetry event coming to Flagstaff: the Individual World Poetry Slam. Over four nights, I attended three events: a Last Chance Slam (a one night competition to fill the last remaining IWPS slot), a bout, and the finals. Following Saturday night, what had been a mere inclination towards slam poetry became an adamant passion. 

> Often, seeing the world through their eyes lead me to blink back tears

I've tried about a dozen times to try and explain the experience of the IWPS finals to those that weren't there, and failed the same number. Imagine a microphone in front of a seated auditorium. Now imagine there's a person behind it. Maybe they're talking adamantly, maybe they're looking slightly above the crowd. Chances are they're talking about an issue you can only tangentially relate to at best. 

Now imagine that that tangential issue has become your whole world. The poet performing has commanded your attention so much that the rest of the world may as well have fallen away. That tangential issue has become intimate and moving. For a few minutes, the poet's thoughts are your thoughts; their feelings, your feelings. 

I learned about losing a child to abortion. I learned about the struggles of growing up black in America. I learned about fighting suicide when it looks like the best friend you have. I learned about being a doctor in Darfur. I learned how lucky I am to have grown up with parents who love me and each other. 

None of this was learned from reading, or watching a movie. All this perspective, all this impossible insight, was gained by standing in the shoes of the poet at the mic. Often, seeing the world through their eyes lead me to blink back tears. Yet at the end of the night, I walked into the air with a sense of appreciation, gratitude, and oneness for my fellow human beings I don't know if I've ever felt before. 

So now it's two days later. I'm still reeling from the whole experience, but have been able to reflect at least a little. I am coming to terms with my lack of giving back through performing. I don't feel slam is the medium I can most effectively communicate in. Yet, my life was just altered by this art form. I saw the oneness between me and those around me. And in pursuit of that perspective, that enlightenment, I have come to this conclusion: I may not have much to say, but I still have so, so much to hear.
