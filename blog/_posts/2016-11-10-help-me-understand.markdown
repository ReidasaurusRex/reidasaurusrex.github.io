title: Help Me Understand
excerpt: An Open Letter to Trump Supporters
---

Dear supporter of Donald Trump, 

I'm writing this letter selfishly. It's my hope that you'll read it, and perhaps be willing to tell me why you choose to support our future president. If anything in this comes off as vindictive or accusatory, it's not my intention. I'm curious, and have a desire to understand where you're coming from. I'd be really grateful if you chose to assist me. 

If you'd like, a little bit about me so you can know why I need to ask for your opinion. The thing I aspire towards most in life is compassion. From the observations I've made throughout my life, I've chosen to try and lead a life of peace, happiness, and harmony, for all people and things, and it's my belief that compassion is the best instrument to achieve these goals. Yes, I fit the title of hippy pretty well, but that doesn't mean I'll respond to your opinions by handing you a joint and putting on a Pink Floyd album; if you'd like, I'll say nothing. Again, what I really desire is to understand, not try to impress my own feelings.

I think the primary reason I'm asking for your assistance is that I, like maybe most, live in my own little opinion bubble; the friends I have and the media outlets I gain information from tend to share my opinions and beliefs. Many of these media outlets, as maybe you can relate with, are a little one sided. As a result, I don't see Trump the business man or Trump the stalwart leader. The conclusions I've come to about the president-elect, from the information I've received, is that he is prone to xenophobia, misogyny, and hate speech. I'm really sorry if you find this offensive, it's not my goal. I'd just like you to know why I'm asking for your help and opinions.

I, like you, try to live my life and believe the beliefs I do in an effort to make the world a better place. Thus, these conclusions about Donald Trump I've made, which are in pretty direct contradiction to my leading belief of compassion, are deeply disheaertening, and in many ways even terrifying. If you're willing, please help me see a different opinion. 

If you support him because of his trade policies, I would love to know more about that. 

If you support him because you feel protection from illegal immigration is the most important thing, and he's the man for the job, I'm all ears if you'd articulate that opinion my way. 

If you support him because of his or Pence's stance on the LGBTQ community, please tell me more about those thoughts.

Even if you feel he's the best person to get the Muslim and immigrant communities out of America, and you feel this is what the world needs to be a better place, please help me understand that perspective.

I will not yell at you. I will not call you a bigot. This is simply an honest plea for help. If you'd like, I of course have my own opinions, and would love to chat with you about my own perspective. But if you simply would like to share your own, I'll be extremely appreciative of that too. 

This is not some metaphorical expression or political piece. Please hit the link below, and send me an email. I'd love to receive it.

Thank you, I'm hoping to hear from you soon, <br>
Reid
